## Notes
- Unfortunately it appears that both package & package-lock cannot be rolled into the config folder containing other files that were cluttering the main folder.
- Commenting every line of code may help the process, along with asking AI.
- To remove a package, remove all mentions of it in your code, delete it from the modules folder, and remove it from package.json.
